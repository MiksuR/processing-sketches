# The Unit Circle in the Brachistochrone Metric

![snapshot](https://github.com/MiksuLinuxGuy/processing-sketches/blob/master/Brachistochrone/Circle/circle.png)

This program draws the unit circle in the brachistochrone metric, and it animates balls sliding down four barchistochrones.
The brachistochrone metric is a function that tells, how long it takes for a ball to roll from one point to another along a [brachistochrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_curve).
Thus, instead of measuring distance along shortest path, the distance is measured along the path for which it takes the least time for a ball to roll along.

(The code is very messy because it took me so long to make this program that I lost motivation and didn't care to write clean code:sweat_smile:)
