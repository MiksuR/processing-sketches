# Processing sketches

This repository contains mostly all of my processing sketches.

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a Java based language used to make demo programs.

If you want to better understand, how any of these sketches work, create an issue on this repo.
I might make a post or a video explaining the program.

# Update
I have quit using Processing, and I have moved on to using Haskell and the OpenGL bindings for it.
The reason is that debugging Haskell is considerably easier and the code is incredibly clean.
Make sure to check out my [new repo](https://github.com/MiksuLinuxGuy/haskell-opengl/) for Haskell projects.
